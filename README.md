## üöÄ **What Makes ZeroDay-X Unique?**

Unlike traditional homelabs, **ZeroDay-X** integrates **AI**, **3D network models**, and **advanced security tools** that simulate a **dynamic** and **real-time** cybersecurity landscape. With this lab, you can not only attack and defend systems but also **visualize** your **network‚Äôs traffic** and **vulnerabilities** in **3D**.

- **3D Network Visualization**: Watch your network in action in real-time with **Graphviz** or **GNS3**.
- **AI-Powered Threat Detection**: Analyze traffic patterns and automatically identify potential security risks with **machine learning** models.
- **Simulate Real Attacks**: Use **Metasploit**, **Kali Linux**, and **Burp Suite** to conduct penetration tests and exploit vulnerabilities.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Homelab Architecture**

### **Network Segments**:
- **DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)**: Public-facing services (e.g., vulnerable web servers).
- **Internal Network**: Secure services, databases, and intranet systems.
- **VPN Network**: For secure remote access into the lab for penetration tests.
- **Segmentation via VLANs**: For added layers of security and isolation.

### **Real-Time 3D Visualization**:
- Visualize your entire network, including firewalls, web servers, and intrusion detection systems, using **Graphviz**.
- Use **GNS3** for a complete, **interactive 3D network model** where you can control the flow of traffic, identify vulnerabilities, and map out attack paths.

## üìù **Step-by-Step Setup Instructions**

### 1. **Install Virtualization Software**

To run the **ZeroDay-X** homelab on your machine, start by installing **VMware Workstation** or **VirtualBox** (for **Windows** and **MacBook** users).

- **Windows:** [Download VMware Workstation](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
- **MacBook:** [Download VMware Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

### 2. **Download & Install Operating Systems**

You‚Äôll need to download **ISO** files for the following operating systems:

- **Kali Linux**: The ultimate penetration testing platform. [Download Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/downloads/)
- **Windows Server**: For vulnerable target systems. [Download Windows Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server)
- **Ubuntu Server**: For hosting vulnerable apps. [Download Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)
- **pfSense/OPNsense**: Open-source firewall routers. [Download pfSense](https://www.pfsense.org/download/)

### 3. **Create & Configure VMs**

Here‚Äôs how to configure the VMs:

#### **Firewall/Router VM** (pfSense/OPNsense):
- Create a VM and install **pfSense** or **OPNsense** to control traffic between internal/external networks and isolate attack paths.
  
#### **Penetration Testing VM** (Kali Linux):
- Set up **Kali Linux** with your preferred penetration testing tools (**Metasploit**, **Nmap**, **Burp Suite**, etc.).

#### **Target Systems** (Windows Server, Ubuntu):
- Set up vulnerable systems and intentionally expose them to known exploits (e.g., outdated SMB, weak credentials).

#### **Security Monitoring VM** (Splunk or ELK Stack):
- Install **Splunk** or the **ELK Stack** to monitor logs and detect any malicious activity.

### 4. **Set Up 3D Network Modeling**

You‚Äôll need to install **Graphviz** for visualizing your network in a **3D model**. This will allow you to:

- Map out the architecture and visualize traffic flows in real time.
- Highlight areas of risk and potential attack paths.
- Use **GNS3** for full control of network topologies.

Install Graphviz from [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/) and visualize network connections as they occur.

## üîê **Best Practices for Security Testing**

### **Snapshot Your VMs**:
- Always take snapshots before performing tests or running risky commands.
- Rollback when things go wrong. **You never know when a 0-day might hit.**

### **Network Segmentation**:
- Keep your **DMZ** and **Internal Network** isolated.
- Use **VLANs** for logical network separation and security.

### **AI-Powered Threat Detection**:
- Configure **Elastic Stack** or any machine learning tool to analyze network traffic for **anomalous behaviors** (like sudden port scans or DDoS).
